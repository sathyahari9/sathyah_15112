Python Piano Hero project


Hello User!

Welcome to my Python piano hero project. It is a game in style similar to guitar hero played by people across the world, only difference- you use a piano instead.

Online products don't offer a unique way to play the piano. Most of them use basic GUI and standard input/output for their programs. I have created a novel way for the user to play the piano - Using the webcam!

OpenCV is a library that can be used to manipulate computer imagery. I created a virtual piano in Python using libraries such as OpenCV, pyAudio and Tkinter.

Instructions:
Run the following terminal command in the parent "sathyah_TP3" folder:

cd piano

Install the following libraries-

Run the following commands in your terminal:

pip3 install opencv-python

pip3 install pyaudio

pip3 install tkinter

You might get an error regarding the installing numpy, so for safety purposes, install numpy:

pip3 install numpy

After doing this, do the following:

python3 piano1.py

It will run the program.

The GUI is fairly easy to navigate
Once you press play, it will take you to the menu screen.

Press "Game Mode" to play the game mode version of Piano Hero. You can select a game file and then press play to play.

Press "SOLO" to the play the solo mode of the game. 

You can also record audio by clicking on the "start record" button and stop it by clicking on the "stop record" button.

To play previous recordings, press the "Play Output" button.
